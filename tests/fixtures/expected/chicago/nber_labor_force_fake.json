(cid:16)Missing(cid:17) Workers and (cid:16)Missing(cid:17) Jobs Since the Pandemic Hobijn and (cid:147)ahin A Mathematical details A.1 Six-Flow Decomposition of the Participation Rate The state of the labor market can be summarized by two shares, the share of the population that is employed in month t, which we denote by E , and the share that is unemployed, U . t t The share of nonparticipants, N , is simply implied by the constraint that the three shares add t up to one. The transition probabilities determine the evolution of these shares according to the following two equations22 E = (1−P −P )E +P U +P (1−E −U ), and (12) t E,U,t E,N,t t−1 U,E,t t−1 N,E,t t−1 t−1 U = (1−P −P )U +P E +P (1−E −U ). (13) t U,E,t U,N,t t−1 E,U,t t−1 N,U,t t−1 t−1 For the purpose of our decomposition it is easier to write these equations in matrix form. The state of the labor is represented by the vector (cid:104) (cid:105)′ s = E U . (14) t t t Given this de(cid:28)nition, equations (12)-(13) can be written as ∆s = s −s = d +P s , (15) t t t−1 t t t−1 where (cid:34) (cid:35) (cid:34) (cid:35) P −P −P −P P −P N,E,t E,N,t E,U,t N,E,t U,E,t N,E,t d = , and P = . (16) t t P P −P −P −P −P N,U,t E,U,t N,U,t U,E,t U,N,t N,U,t For our decomposition we split the movements of the stocks into two parts. The (cid:28)rst part is the changes in the long-run value of the state vector if the current (cid:29)ow probabilities remain unchanged. This often is referred to as the (cid:29)ow steady-state and it is the value s¯ for which t ∆s = 0. For given matrices d and P , it is equal to t t t s¯ = −P−1d (17) t t t The second part is the changes in deviations from the steady state, (s −s¯ ). The change t−1 t−1 22 The estimated transition probabilities are margin adjusted, using the method in Elsby et al. (2015) to satisfy these equations. (cid:16)Missing(cid:17) Workers and (cid:16)Missing(cid:17) Jobs Since the Pandemic Hobijn and (cid:147)ahin in the state vector is related to these two parts as follows ∆s = P (s −s¯ ) = P (s −s¯ )−P (s¯ −s¯ ). (18) t t t−1 t t t−1 t−1 t t t−1 Rearrangingtermsin(18),wecanwritethecurrentdeviationfromthesteadystateasafunction of the current change in the state vector. That is, (s −s¯ ) = (I +P )(s −s¯ )−(I +P )(s¯ −s¯ ) (19) t t t t−1 t−1 t t t−1 = (I +P )P−1∆s t t t This allows us to write the current change in the state as the sum of the transitional dynamics through the past change in the state and the changes in the steady state. ∆s = P (I +P )P−1 ∆s −P ∆s¯ . (20) t t t−1 t−1 t−1 t t The (cid:28)nal step is to attribute the changes in the steady state, i.e., ∆s¯ to changes in the t di(cid:27)erent matrices made up of transition probabilities. For this, we use that 1 1 ∆d = − ∆P (s¯ +s¯ )− (P +P )∆s¯ , (21) t t t t−1 t t−1 t 2 2 where (cid:88) (cid:88) ∂d (cid:88) (cid:88) ∂P t t ∆d = ∆P , and ∆P = ∆P . (22) t s,s′,t t s,s′,t ∂P ∂P s,s′,t s,s′,t s∈{E,U,N}s′∈{E,U,N} s∈{E,U,N}s′∈{E,U,N} Using this we can trace the change in the steady state back to changes in the (cid:29)ow transitions that drive ∆d and ∆P , which yields t t (cid:20) 1 (cid:21)−1(cid:20) 1 (cid:21) ∆s¯ = (P +P ) −∆d − ∆P (s¯ +s¯ ) . (23) t t t−1 t t t t−1 2 2 Combining equations (20) and (23), we write the change in the state vector as the sum of transitional dynamics plus the changes in the steady state attributable to the six di(cid:27)erent (cid:29)ow transition probabilities. ∆s = P (I +P )P−1 ∆s +P (P +P )−1[2∆d +∆P (s¯ +s¯ )] (24) t t t−1 t−1 t−1 t t t−1 t t t t−1 (cid:16)Missing(cid:17) Workers and (cid:16)Missing(cid:17) Jobs Since the Pandemic Hobijn and (cid:147)ahin This is a decomposition of changes in the state vector s . The labor force participation rate is t LFPR = E +U = ι′s , (25) t t t 2 t where ι is the 2-dimensional summation operator, i.e., a column vector with ones. The de- 2 composition we use for the LFPR is t ∆LFPR = ι′P (I +P )P−1 ∆s +ι′P (P +P )−1[2∆d +∆P (s¯ +s¯ )] (26) t 2 t t−1 t−1 t−1 2 t t t−1 t t t t−1 A.2 Attachment Wedge If those who are unemployed were as attached to the labor force as the employed, then the cyclical component would have no e(cid:27)ect on participation. To understand this, it is important to realize that the current change in the LFPR is a distributed lag of current and past changes in the (cid:29)ow steady-state.23 Because this lag structure is complicated, we focus on the change in the (cid:29)ow steady-state due to changes in the job-loss and job-(cid:28)nding rates, which we denote by c ∆LFPR , to explain the intuition for what drives the cycle component in our decomposition. t In Appendix A, we show that this equals 1 c (cid:0)¯ ¯ (cid:1) ∆LFPR = − LFPR P −P ((1−u¯ )∆P −u¯ ∆P ), (27) t D t U,N,t E,N,t t E,U,t t U,E,t t where LFPR is the (cid:29)ow steady-state labor force participation rate and u¯ is the (cid:29)ow steady- t t state unemployment rate, both averaged across periods t and t−1. D is the determinant of t P ¯ t = 1/ 2 (P t +P t−1 ), P ¯ E,N,t = 1/ 2 (P E,N,t +P E,N,t−1 ), and P ¯ U,N,t = 1/ 2 (P U,N,t +P U,N,t−1 ).24 The third and fourth terms of this expression are the ones that matter the most for the intuition of what drives the participation cycle. The third term is the di(cid:27)erence between the rate that unemployed and employed workers (cid:0)¯ ¯ (cid:1) leave the labor force: P −P . We refer to this term as the attachment wedge. It U,N,t E,N,t captures the di(cid:27)erence in the attachment to the labor force of those unemployed versus those employed. It is positive because the employed are more attached to the labor force than the ¯ ¯ unemployed, i.e., P > P . A positive attachment wedge is necessary for a procyclical U,N,t E,N,t participation cycle. The fourth term, ((1−u¯ )∆P −u¯ ∆P ), is the change in the (cid:29)ow steady-state un- t E,U,t t U,E,t employmentrateduetochangesinthejob-lossandjob-(cid:28)ndingrates. Itcapturestheshiftinthe 23 See Appendix A for a derivation of this lag expression. 24 The determinant D is positive in all periods for the observed transition probabilities in the data. t (cid:16)Missing(cid:17) Workers and (cid:16)Missing(cid:17) Jobs Since the Pandemic composition of the labor force between unemployed and em ments of persons between these two states and not due to margin. Equation (27) is important because it shows that, to u participation rate, it is essential to study the likelihood of w than workers entering the labor force. This likelihood is a individuals within the labor force since there is a quantita between the unemployed and employed.
