Version 1 Reviewer Report 04 August 2020 https://doi.org/10.5256/f1000research.26624.r65638 © 2020 Rico-Castro P. This is an open access peer review report distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Pilar Rico-Castro Fundación Española para la Ciencia y la Tecnología (FECYT), Madrid, Spain This work addresses how the recent COVID-19 pandemic has boosted open access practices among publishers and researchers, and it concludes that current practices include neither proper nor adequate licensing of research articles by publishers. Despite the fact that publishers comply with OA compromises with authors, they do not meet with larger open science requirements - especially those regarding scientific contents' reusability. This paper opens up a very necessary discussion about the role that publishers can play as enablers or avoiders for making scientific knowledge findable, accessible, reusable, and interoperable, even when they fulfill formal open access requirements. The analysis is made for the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, a time in history in which humans have been confronted with a vital need of scientific responses for their simplest every day routines. This extreme circumstance is used to light the real dimension of our dependence from open science, not only as researchers but as human beings, and to point each actor's responsibility in providing the conditions for scientific advances to meet with the FAIR and the OS requirements. However, the work has a few weaknesses that need to be properly addressed. Major concerns: 1.- Need for clarification of the article's objective and the research question. Under the \"Introduction\" section a variety of ideas are mixed and the research objective is not clearly stated. Mentions to the \"scientific collaboration\" with no previous context nor ulterior analysis, and sentences like \"we wonder if the scientific community is ready to share and consume openly such information\" contribute to blur the research objective. A clear statement on the research objective is needed. 2.- Need for clarification of the research object. It is not clear whether or not pre-prints are included within the scope of the analysis. The paper needs an explicit declaration on that. Page 15 of 32 F1000Research 2020, 9:649 Last updated: 19 AUG 2020 3.- The comparative method has not been adopted correctly for the following reasons: - The comparability of the search \"2019-nCoV OR 2019nCoV OR COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR (Wuhan AND corona-virus)\", for which only articles published in a four months period has been considered, with the search \"SARS CoV\" OR \"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\", for which a three years period has been considered (2003 to 2006) and with the search \"MERS CoV\" OR \"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus\" for which a different three years period has been considered (2013 to 2016) needs a previous normalization. The time periods are very different (4 months vs. 3 years), and that invalidates the comparison. For sorting this out, the author could either normalize the data for all the periods analyzed to a \"month unit\", or use in their analysis only the first 4 months of all the health crises in comparison. - The authors are comparing an open period (this crisis is not yet over and we do not know how long it would last) with two closed crises. This should be acknowledged in the text as a methodological limitation. - The health crises under comparison contain large differences amongst them that require to be taken into consideration and to be acknowledged in the text as a methodological limitation. That the three situations have been classified as health emergencies is not enough for them to be comparable. They hold important differences regarding infection rates and death rates. The rapid spread of the recent pandemic has led governments all around the world to adopt never seen before very drastic measures (like lockdown) with a formidable impact on our economic system. Under this circumstance, a huge pressure has been put on the scientific community; therefore it has affected publication rates. In addition, the recent pandemic is taking place where the public debate about open access to scientific research is at its peak time. Many governments and funding agencies all around the world are launching OA policies (PlanS, as an example) and negotiating transformative agreements with large commercial publishers. All these conditions have a strong potential to affect OA availability of publications, both regarding publishers' editorial practices and researchers' publication patterns, thus affecting the comparison levels of the different periods considered in the analysis. All these elements should be acknowledged as difficulties for the comparison in the paper. 4.- Unpaywall categories are not mutually-exclusive. This should be properly addressed and explained in the analysis. A publication can be Gold and Green OA simultaneously, and it can also be Hybrid and Green OA simultaneously. Moreover, Bronze category can be combined with each of the remaining three categories (Green, Gold, and Hybrid) as well as with the Gold-Green and Hybrid-Green combinations. The only ones that are mutually-exclusive are Gold and Hybrid categories. This opens a major methodological concern: whether data have been double counted or not. Therefore: - What compatibilities exist between the different categories should be properly explained. - A clarification about whether or not there is double counting needs to be made. - In the case that double counting has been avoided, authors must explain from which category the items have been removed from, and under which criterion. - Authors do not explain how they found out that Green and Hybrid papers are classified under Page 16 of 32 F1000Research 2020, 9:649 Last updated: 19 AUG 2020 Bronze category. This explanation should be included under the results section. 5.- Clarify the role of CC licenses within the OS requirements. The relationship between CC licenses and OS reuse requirements is not properly mentioned in the text. Brief explanations to clarify what CC licenses are and what role they play is needed. 6.- Delete non-evidence based conclusions. The following sentences are not based in any proven evidence or data: - \"From the data, it can be seen that the number of articles published during the selected period increases daily\". There are no data referring to daily publications in the paper. - \"Shortening of acceptance rates by journals is giving rise to information overload both for the scientific community but also for society, making it difficult to ascertain what really has a significant scientific value and as a consequence may affect decision-making\". This cannot be inferred from the analyzed data. Nothing has been proven about the shortening of acceptance rates by journals or about the scientific value of the publications. None of these issues have been addressed in the paper. - \"In addition to the massive scientific production, after the pandemic declaration, publishers have made, not only COVID-19 but also previous SARS CoV-1 and MERS CoV related papers, openly available\". This cannot be inferred from the analyzed data and it has not been proven. (Actually, in my opinion, the most likely explanation for finding SARS CoV-1 and MERS CoV related papers in OA is that the embargo period has already expired.) - \"… as the majority of the documentation is not free all the time, the number of subscriptions might be affected since it is possible that new non-subscribed readers obtained during this pandemic period have read articles from these journals and want to continue doing it.\" This cannot be inferred from the analyzed data and it has not been proven. Actually, it is quite unlikely since scientific journals' subscriptions are not decided nor negotiated by researchers, but by academic libraries. - \"What is most interesting about the effect of the COVID-19 emergency on scientific research disclosure is what it says about the current publication model: it fails when a critical need arises for fast data dissemination\". This sentence from the conclusion section goes against the evidence presented in the analysis since authors have shown that of a total of 5,611 published articles related to COVID-19 pandemic, 4,986 were in OA in some way or another. Also, nothing has been proven about the speed of dissemination; therefore no conclusions can be drawn about this issue. - \"We finally conclude that it seems clear that all stakeholders agree that Science only works when knowledge is shared.\" There is no evidence to sustain this sentence. It should be either proven or deleted. 7.- Strength evidence-based conclusions: - \"While Gold OA makes papers available immediately by the publishing journal itself, the predominant Bronze OA category, found by the present study, means that papers are freely hosted…\" This whole paragraph contains the main evidence-based conclusion of the work. The Page 17 of 32 F1000Research 2020, 9:649 Last updated: 19 AUG 2020 idea that OA is not enough, and that despite the fact that publishers put a multitude of works in open access in response to a certain situation (in this case pandemic) it that does not guarantee an open, findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable science, should be a strength in the paper. - \"Our analysis demonstrates that the current alternative that is in use falls short of expectations of being the best model, since this fast opening lacks basic OA principles, which are required in order to be transparent, reusable and…\" This sentence contains the second main evidence-based conclusion of the work. It should be a strength in the conclusions section of the paper. Minor concerns: 1.- Need for brief definitions: - Definitions of Open Access and Open Science concepts as well as proper citations about both concepts are missing. Open Science means much more than Open Access. A proper brief definition of both concepts is needed for the reader not to mix them up. - \"In order to analyse publications concerning COVID-19 and their level of openness, we have chosen PubMed instead of other multidisciplinary databases, like Web of Science (WoS) or Scopus\". Clarify in this sentence that PubMed, WoS, and Scopus are databases for bibliographic references. 2.- Need for cites. - \"In this unique context of the pandemic, publishers are announcing massive OA changes, primarily by making their corona-virus-related articles freely available through databases, such as PubMed Central, together with other public repositories\". This paragraph lacks proper citations and a more detailed explanation on the cited new practices launched by publishers that differentiates pre-print repositories from opening peer reviewed published articles. 3.- Need for web references of Scopus, PubMed, MEDLINE, and PubMed Central (PMC), as it has been done for WoS. 4.- Correct the expression \"five categories\" because there are only four (Gold, Hybrid, Green, and Bronze). 5.- Clarification of the meaning of \"Q1\" in Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4. It is confusing since the reader tends to think of the 1st quartile of the JIF. 6.- Change Figure 1a since it is confusing. It is not straightforward to see that the top portion is a part of the bottom portion. It looks like the addition of both is the total. There are more appropriate figures to show both the total and its proportion in a more intuitive manner. 7.- Clarify Figure 1c. Figure 1c needs further clarification in the text about the meaning of \"Via page says license\", and \"Via free article\" categories. 8.- Mention why the publishers' and journals' analysis has not been made for SARS CoV-1 nor Page 18 of 32 F1000Research 2020, 9:649 Last updated: 19 AUG 2020 MERS CoV searches. The analysis conducted for the three periods is different. No description regarding neither publishers nor journals has been made for publications about SARS CoV-1 nor MERS CoV. 9.- Completing data in Figure 3a. The percentages in graph 3a add up no more than 68.6%. This means that there are 31.4% of the publications that are not included in the graph. This is important to be noticed since the remaining 31.4% is a higher figure than the largest category represented (29.7%). It is recommended to include a category \"others\" with 31.4% of the publishers. The dispersion of the data is very large. Focusing the analysis only on Elsevier, Wiley and Springer is reducing it to 54% of the data. This should be mentioned it in the text. 10.- Figure 3b refers exclusively to 12.7% of the data. This should be mentioned it in the text. 11.- Explain graph 4b in the text. 12.- Change graph 4d. This graph is not very accurate. I suggest using a similar graph than the previous one (4c). Finally, this paper opens the door for further research to be done in the future, like the analysis of the relationship between the four categories of OA (Gold, Hybrid, Green, and Bronze), the CC licenses that they use, and the publishing practices of the different large publishing companies. It would be fantastic if the authors continue their work in this way. Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature? Partly Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound? Partly Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others? Yes If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate? Partly Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility? Yes Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results? Partly Competing Interests: No competing interests were disclosed.

This is an open access peer review report distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Jonathon Alexis Coates University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK Summary: Arrizabalaga et al. address the important issue of accessibility in biomedical publishing. Utilising data from Unpaywall the authors investigate the open access status of COVID-19 articles published within the first four months of 2020. The majority of the COVID-19 literature investigated in this study are classified as bronze open-access, potentially subject to removal behind a paywall at any time. There is also a comparison to other epidemics (SARS-Cov-1 and MERS) and more recent literature that enables some comparisons between the literature. There are inherent weaknesses to such a study due to the time period chosen which, due to the nature of the temporary open-access of many articles, is subject to change in the future. However, this is acknowledged by the authors in the text and can be further addressed through additional discussion. Overall, this is an important topic assessing the early phase of the pandemic with this study requiring some relatively minor changes. Major concerns:"
